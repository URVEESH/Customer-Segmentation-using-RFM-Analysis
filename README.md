# Customer-Segmentation-using-RFM-Analysis

Knowing your customers has become essential to running a successful business in the ever-changing world of online retail. It's not just a competitive advantage, but a need in today's market to be able to segment clients according to their buying habits. The purpose of this research, "Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis" is to use an eCommerce dataset to explore the nuances of consumer behaviors.

The essence of this project lies in its focus on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, a proven methodology for customer segmentation. This technique assesses customers based on three key dimensions: how recently they have made a purchase (Recency), how often they engage in transactions (Frequency), and the monetary value they bring (Monetary). By analyzing these aspects, we can categorize customers into different segments, each characterized by distinct purchasing behaviors. This segmentation enables us to tailor marketing strategies effectively, ensuring that the right message reaches the right customer at the right time.

The approach involves a systematic examination of the provided dataset, starting with thorough data preprocessing to ensure data quality and reliability. Following this, we will calculate the RFM values for each customer, providing a quantitative basis for our segmentation. We will then employ clustering techniques to group customers into segments, facilitating a deeper understanding of the different customer types within the dataset.

The project aims to provide actionable insights that can be directly applied in marketing strategies. By identifying various customer segments, we can develop focused marketing campaigns that resonate with the specific needs and preferences of each group. This targeted approach is expected to enhance customer engagement, increase sales, and elevate customer satisfaction.
